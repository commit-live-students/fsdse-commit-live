## Practice Exercise

* Let's do a small exercise to see how Commit.Live web application, IDE and CLI works together
* Navigate to web application dashboard and click on continue button under current course. This will take you to lesson page.
* To open this repo inside Commit.Live IDE click on `Open in app` button on lesson page and copy the open command which will look like below 

        clive open fsdse-commit-live
        
* Run above command in Commit.Live IDE terminal
* Let's quickly go through what we have in repo

         data - Contains dummy data set
         test - Contains test cases
         build_model.py - File which we are going to run and test
         README.md - Readme file
         
* build_model.py tries to solve one of ML problem using two algorithms below:
    * RandomForestClassifier
    * LogisticRegression
* We will first run test cases present in the test folder and see test case output.Open terminal and run test command
        
        clive test

* This will run test cases against the build_model.py file. Your test case will fail ans say you can improve accuracy even more
* Now open build_model.py and change build method to buildLogisticRegression. You last line in build_model.py should look like below:

          build = buildLogisticRegression
          
* Now again run test command again.This time your test case will pass
* To submit PR and changes to repo use below command:

        clive submit
